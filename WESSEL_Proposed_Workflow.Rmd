I. Literature Review

Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and other bee species play an important ecological role as pollinators for various wildflowers and agricultural crops (Ahrné et al. 2009; McCabe et al. 2022). Despite their ecological importance, pollinators face numerous threats from habitat loss, pesticide exposure, climate change, and disease, with many bee populations declining worldwide (Goulson et al. 2008). Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization emerges as a growing concern due to its rapid expansion and transformation of landscapes that were once natural habitats into fragmented urban environments. Urbanization can have a large effect on Bombus spp. flower visitation rates and pollination success through changes in foraging behavior (Glaum et al. 2017; Harrison & Winfree 2015). Urban heat islands, or the increased temperatures often observed in cities due to concrete and reduced green spaces, further complicate the challenges faced by pollinators (Harrison & Winfree 2015). Together, these pressures can lead to declines in Oregon bee populations, leading to cascading effects impacting the numerous ecosystem services offered. Understanding how urbanization impacts emergence patterns of Bombus spp. is crucial, as these factors are closely tied to their ability to effectively pollinate and maintain stable populations.

Recent research has found that climate change, often resulting from urbanization, is altering phenology, with spring events generally occurring earlier (Stemkovski et al. 2020). For Bombus spp., increased (spring) temperatures have been shown to directly lead to advanced phenology, prompting earlier emergence and activity periods (Prestele et al. 2021). Harrison & Winfree (2015) observed that urban habitats support a greater abundance of late-season bees compared to forest habitats, likely due to the presence of late-blooming plants. They also suggest that urban warming may act as an "ecological filter," reducing species diversity and resulting in a more homogenized bee community in cities. Similarly, Blasi et al. (2023) found that over the past 20 years, a citizen-science dataset has shown that Bombus spp. emergence across Sweden has advanced significantly, though responses varied based on species traits. As in Harrison & Winfree’s findings, warmer temperatures substantially advanced the flight period for early-emerging species, while late-emerging species exhibited no consistent trend. This variability in response among Bombus spp. may contribute to shifts in community composition, favoring species that can better synchronize their life cycles with the altered urban floral availability. Little is known about how these phenological changes impact pollination success across diverse urban ecosystems, especially in areas like Oregon where agricultural productivity and biodiversity heavily depend on stable bee populations.

Understanding these emergence patterns and phenological shifts is crucial for pollinator diversity conservation efforts. Using the Oregon Bee Atlas (OBA), census population block data, and monthly temperature reading from the PRISM group, we are able to develop a more comprehensive analysis of how urbanization and temperature variability affect Bombus spp. Li et al. (2020) demonstrated that human population density can serve as a reliable indicator of urbanization, allowing us to use census data as a proxy for assessing the intensity of urban development and its impacts on bee populations. By combining monthly temperature data and population density, we are able to assess the response of Bombus spp. Across various levels of urbanization, allowing us to identify species-specific emergence patterns and population trends among different bee species.

The data that we will be combining is the OBA dataset and merging it with US Census data to get whether that bee observation were in a rural or urban area. We will do the same thing with the PRISM data, merging each of the bee observations with temperature, likely joining on latitude and longitude in order to see what the average temperature is in the area the bee was recorded. Broadly, we will address the question of how does peak emergence vary with urbanization and average climate, by adding a column of data to each of the bee observations (a column for climate and a column for urbanization) and seeing if there are patterns based on how urban a place is or how warm/cold a place’s climate is. This is needed now because past studies have been able to look at bee emergence in other regions of the US or in other countries, but few studies have combined looking at the emergence of these particular species, Oregon Bombus spp., in conjunction with the urbanization and climate gradients present in Oregon. Urbanization and climate change are rapidly changing natural landscapes with effects on pollinators that are not fully understood. Carrying out these analyses and creating visualizations can reveal important insights on pollinator health and adaptability.

Our research question is: How does peak emergence, for Bombus vosnesenskii and Bombus melanopygus, vary along climatic and urbanization gradients? Our first hypothesis is that urbanization will delay the peak emergence of Bombus vosnesenskii and Bombus melanopygus, and there will be higher variability in emergence in urban areas due to the presence of different landscapes within urban areas. Our second hypothesis is that areas that have higher mean temperatures will show earlier emergence times. Our third hypothesis is that urbanization and climate will have compounded effects, showing earlier emergence in urban areas with higher mean temperatures.

II. Dataset identification

One additional dataset that we will be using to address our question is the US Census Bureau data. This can be found at: https://data.census.gov/, https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-total-cities-and-towns.html. The US Census Bureau collected the data and the data was collected through the 2020 Census which used household surveys to collect demographic, social, and housing data. The columns include county codes, names of cities/states, population, housing units, the area of land, area of water, and population density. We are most interested in the population column. To create a gradient of urbanization we were thinking of using the Population and Housing Unit Estimates, specifically the Population Totals, as a proxy for urbanization. And split the population totals of each city/region into 4 different categories (urban, suburban, rural, subrural).

Then we were also interested in looking at the Census block data (https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-maps/2020/geo/2020-census-block-maps.html). These are areas that have geographic boundaries and are uniquely numbered with a census block number. These can help us to further classify the different areas to a certain urbanization level. Population is counted for each census block, providing a proxy for urbanization.

The other dataset that we will be working with it PRISM Climate data which can be found at: https://prism.oregonstate.edu/. Oregon State University and the PRISM Climate Group collected this data. It was collected from a network of weather stations and interpolated to account for geographic and topographic variation. The key columns include date, mean temperature (°C), precipitation (mm), latitude and longitude, and elevation (m).


III. Workflow plan

To begin working through the data, we will first start by collecting spatial census block population data and PRISM group climate bil files. Once this is captured, we will first clean the OBA data, making sure to filter to get our two Bombus spp. species. When cleaning this data, we will remove columns that are not important to this analysis and remove rows with NA values. A DOY column will be calculated for each observation using the mutate function and observed on column. Next, using the prism R package, the monthly temperature will be calculated for each observation, taking in account the coordinate location of them. Next, in order to apply a human density estimate to each observation, the spatial data values will create areas of Oregon, taking into account if the observation falls into this coordinate range. In hopes of using a centroid approach, the population data will be added depending on where they fall. After this is completed, our dataset will be complete containing the necessary OBA data (species, latitude, longitude), PRISM data (tmean1-12, tmean_annual), and population data (pop). After this dataset is made, the PRISM data will be subsetted to just spring temperature months as we determined this is the most influential time period (Feb-June, months 2-6). Population data will be binned into four different urbanization levels (rural (1), subrural (2) , suburban (3) , urban (4)). Separating urbanization levels into different categories will help us hopefully recognize trends more easily, accounting for some variation in development level. After this is created all data will be added to a linear mixed model using the lme4 R package. DOY will be the response variable with spring temperature, urbanization level, latitude, and longitude as fixed variables (Possibly considering springTemp * latitude relationship). Species will be the random variable in this model to account for species differences. The step() function will be used to assess the best model using backwards selection. An AIC() and variance test with the car R package will be conducted to assess strength and error in the model. Next, a function will be created to apply this model to each species individually to get a more species-specific response. The function, SpeciesLLM will loop through a list of all the unique species in the dataset, apply the model to each species, returning the displayed values in a dataset. An ANOVA will possibly be used to help assess the statistical difference between results taken from the model. Our end result is to be able to create graphics showing DOY of emergence as a function of urbanization and temperature. Adding onto this, creating a graphic showing species specific sensitivities to these variables as well. As we work through this analysis, depending on how long this takes the number of bumblebee species will change. We are starting with two for smoother analysis design purposes.esign purposes.
